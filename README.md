# Channels Allocation

This project is designed to solve the channel allocation problem. In a hospital, in a hospital, important resources should be allocated to patients first, as well as the mobile network.

Suppose there are 10 people in the hospital, 3 patients and 7 normal people, and there are 5 base stations around the hospital, every station has 2 channels (10 channels in total). All the distances of the people from the base stations are randomly generated.

We define two channel users of the same base station as interference users.

In order to make the patients has the largest SINR, We proposed 4 different algorithms to solve this problem.

Two Phase Algorithm ----- TwoPhase.m

Matching Algorithm ----- Matching.m

Our Algorithm ----- Own.m

Control Group ----- random.m
